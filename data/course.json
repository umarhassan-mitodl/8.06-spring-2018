It introduces some of the important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including two-dimensional electron systems, the fine structure of hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering. The lectures and lecture notes for this course form the basis of Zwiebach\u2019s textbook *Mastering Quantum Mechanics* published by\u00a0[MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mastering-quantum-mechanics)\u00a0in April 2022.",
